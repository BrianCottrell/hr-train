# HR Train
HR Train app for training new employees in VR
https://devpost.com/software/hr-train
## Inspiration
Our team members have all experienced the challeges of joining a new company and navigating employee onboarding resources and wanted to come up with a better way. We recently began learning how to create apps involving 360 degree images and all agreed that it could be a great way to train employees.
## What it does
HR Train allows employees of a company to access all of their onboarding and training resources from a single app. They can also open an interactive 360 degree visualization of their workplace filled with useful information.
## How we built it
We built the core Android app around the Flock messaging app, which allowed us to perform basic employee onboarding functions simply by typing commands. We included a feature which allows users to open a 360 degree image of their workplace and interact with various pieces of equipment.
## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges coming up with the best way to receive information while using our visualization app in its various modes of operation.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to create a detailed VR experience which we found informative as well as fun and interesting to use.
## What we learned
We learned about the limitations and challenges of working with 360 degree images.
## What's next for HR Train
We would like to deploy a fully functional onboarding app at a workplace to learn more about what features should be added or improved and eventually make it available to others.
